## Result
### Edges2Shoes  
Image size is 128 x 128 and __normal discriminator__ is used, __not conditional discriminator__. You can check what the conditional discriminator is in ```Advanced-BicycleGAN``` in this repository. It generates slightly more diverse, clear and realistic images than the ones below.

## Model description
<p align="center"><img width="100%" src="png/model.png" /></p>  

### cVAE-GAN
cVAE-GAN is an __image reconstruction process.__ From this, the encoder can extract proper latent code z containing features of given image 'B'. Through this process, the generator can generate image which has features of 'B' but the generator also needs to be able to fool the discriminator. Futhermore, cVAE-GAN uses KL-divergence to make the generator be able to generate images using randomly sampled z from normal distribution at the test phase.

### cLR-GAN
This is an __latent code reconstruction process.__ If many latent codes correspond to a same output mode, this is called mode collapse. The main purpose of cLR-GAN is to make invertible mapping between B and z. It leads to bijective consistency between latent encoding and output modes that is significant in preventing model from __mode collapse.__  

## Prerequisites
* [Python 3.5+](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
* [PyTorch 0.2.0](http://pytorch.org/)

## Training step Â 
Before getting started, suppose that we want to optmize G which can convert __domain A into B__.  
  
__real_B__ : A real image of domain B from training data set  
__fake_B__ : A fake image of domain B made by the generator  
__encoded_z__ : Latent code z made by the encoder  
__random_z__ : Latent code z sampled randomly from normal distribution
  
__1. Optimize D__ 
* Optimize D in cVAE-GAN using real_B and fake_B made with encoded_z(__Adversarial loss__).  
* Optimize D in cLR-GAN using real_B and fake_B made with random_z(__Adversarial loss__).  

__2. Optimize G or E__  
* Optimize G and E in cVAE-GAN using fake_B made with encoded_z(__Adversarial loss__).
* Optimize G and E in cVAE-GAN using real_B and fake_B made with encoded_z(__Image reconstruction loss__).  
* Optimize E in cVAE-GAN using the encoder outputs, mu and log_variance(__KL-div loss__).  
* Optimize G in cLR-GAN using fake_B made with random_z(__Adversarial loss__).  

__3. Optimize ONLY G(Do not update E)__  
* Optimize G in cLR-GAN using random_z and the encoder output mu(__Latent code reconstruction loss__).

## Implementation details

* __Multi discriminator__  
First, __two discriminators__ are used for __two different last output sizes(PatchGAN)__; 14x14 and 30x30, for the discriminator to learn from two different scales.  
Second, each discriminator from above have __two discriminators__ because of two images each made with __encoded_z(cVAE-GAN) and random_z(cLR-GAN)__ from N(mu, std) and N(0, 1) respectively. Two discriminators are better than just one discriminator for both distributions.   
Totally, __four discriminators__ are used; __(cVAE-GAN, 14x14), (cVAE-GAN, 30x30), (cLR-GAN, 14x14) and (cLR-GAN, 30x30).__  

* __Encoder__  
__E_ResNet__ is used, __not E_CNN__. Residual block in the encoder is slightly different with the usual one. Check ResBlock class and Encoder class in model.py.

* __How to inject the latent code z to the generator__  
Inject __only to the input__ by concatenating, not to all intermediate layers

* __Training data__  
Batch size is 1 for both cVAE-GAN and cLR-GAN which means that get two images from the dataloader and distribute to cVAE-GAN and cLR-GAN.

* __How to encode with encoder__  
Encoder returns mu and log_variance. Reparameterization trick is used, so __encoded_z = random_z * std + mu__ such that __std = exp(log_variance / 2).__

* __How to calculate KL divergence__  
Following formula is from [here](http://yunjey47.tistory.com/43). Also if you want to see simple and clean VAE code, you can check [here](https://github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial/blob/master/tutorials/03-advanced/variational_auto_encoder/main.py).

From N(0, 1) get KL divergence, so it leads to following formula.

* __How to reconstruct z in cLR-GAN__  
mu and log_variance are derived from the encoder in cLR-GAN. Use __L1 loss between mu and random_z__, not encoded_z and random_z. The reasons are the followings or you can check [here](https://github.com/junyanz/BicycleGAN/issues/14).  
  
  1. cLR-GAN is for point estimation not distribution estimation.  
  2. If std is too big, L1 loss between encoded_z and random_z can be unstable.
